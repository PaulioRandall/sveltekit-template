# Organs

Organs are components that belong to specific pages, routes, or path hierarchy. The folder sub structure mirrors that of the `/routes` folder. If these sub components were placed in the `/routes` folder then they would be directly exposed as pages or endpoints.

Alternately, it's common to create a `/components` folder where all components that are not pages are stored.
